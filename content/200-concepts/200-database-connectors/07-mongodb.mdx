The MongoDB data source connector connects Prisma to a hosted [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance.

## Example

To connect to a MongoDB server, you need to configure a [`datasource`](../components/prisma-schema/data-sources) block in your [Prisma schema file](../components/prisma-schema):

```prisma file=schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

The fields passed to the `datasource` block are:

- `provider`: Specifies the `mongodb` data source connector.
- `url`: Specifies the [connection URL](#connection-url) for the MongoDB server. In this case, an [environment variable is used](../more/environment-variables) to provide the connection URL.

Because MongoDB is currently a preview feature, you need to explicitly define that in the [`generator`]() block.

```prisma file=schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["mongodb"]
}
```

## Connection details

### Connection URL

The MongoDB connection URL can be configured in different ways depending on how you are hosting your database. The standard configuration is made up of the following components: 

![Structure of the MongoDB connection URL](./mongodb.png)

#### Base URL and path

The base URL and path sections of the connection URL are made up of your authentication credentials followed by the host (and optionally, a port number) and database.

```
mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE
```

The following components make up the _base URL_ of your database:

| Name     | Placeholder | Description                                                                                                     |
| :------- | :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User     | `USERNAME`      | Name of your database user, e.g. `janedoe`                                                                      |
| Password | `PASSWORD`  | Password for your database user                                                                                 |
| Host     | `HOST`      | The host where a [`mongod`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) instance is running. If you are runnnig a sharded cluster this will a [`mongos`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos) instance. This can be a hostname, IP address or UNIX domain socket.                                                   |
| Port     | `PORT`      | Port on which your database server is running, e.g. `1234`. If none is provided the default `27017` is used.                                                      |
| Database | `DATABASE`  | Name of the database to use. If none is specified but the `authSource` option is set then the `authSource` database name is used. If neither the database in the connection string nor the `authSource` option is specified then it defautls to `admin` |

You must [percentage-encode special characters](../../../reference/database-reference/connection-urls#special-characters).

#### Arguments

A connection URL can also take arguments. Here is the same example from above with placeholder values in uppercase letters for three _arguments_:

```
mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?KEY1=VALUE&KEY2=VALUE&KEY3=VALUE
```

The following arguments can be used, **all are optional**:

| Argument name       | Default                | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| `authMechanism`               |                 | Specifies the authentication method used by MongoDB to authenticate the connection. See [authMechanism docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.authMechanism) for a run down on the available options.     |
| `authMechanismProperties`               |                 | Specifies the properties for the `authMechanism` option as a comma separated list, or a colon separated list of key-value pairs. See [authMechanismProperties docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.authMechanismProperties) for a run down on the available options.     |

An example connection URL that sets:

- An `ssl` connection
- A `connectTimeoutMS`
- And the `maxPoolSize`

Would look like the following

```
mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?ssl=true&connectTimeoutMS=5000&maxPoolSize=50
```

## Known limitations

As MongoDB support is currently in preview there are some known limitations that come with adopting Prisma into your MongoDB project, these include:

- Currently **no transaction support**. [Transactions](../../guides/performance-and-optimization/prisma-client-transactions-guide) are relied upon for nested writes. See [github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6716](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6716).
- Currently **no embedded collection support**. See [github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6708](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6708). 
  - Instead try to [normalize your data models](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/data-model-design/#normalized-data-models). This involves
  describing relationships using references between documents.
- The Prisma [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) doesn't currently auto format [`@db.ObjectId`](../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#mongodb) on relations. See [github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6717](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6717).
- The [Migrate](../components/prisma-migrate) and [Introspection](../components/introspection) workflows are currently **not** supported.
- [`@@id`](../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#id-1) and [auto-increment](../../reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#generate-auto-incrementing-integers-as-ids) are **not** currently supported.
- Error handling is incomplete.
